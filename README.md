# Weather-App
"I developed a Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide real-time weather updates. Users can search for cities to view temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions. The app fetches data dynamically via an API, has a responsive design, and ensures a seamless user experience."
